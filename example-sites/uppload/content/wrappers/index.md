# Frontend frameworks

Uppload doesn't depend on a frontend framework like React or Vue.js, but is very easy to use with them. The following examples use the `upload` package with popular frontend frameworks:

- [React](https://codesandbox.io/s/ecstatic-lake-9kqgo)
- [Vue.js](https://codesandbox.io/s/uppload-vue-6i393)

It's very easy to create your own wrapper around Uppload based on your usage using the [API](/api) and [listening to events](/listening-to-events).
