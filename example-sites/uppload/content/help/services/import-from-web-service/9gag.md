2. Click on the "9GAG" button in the widget
3. Paste the 9GAG URL in the textbox
4. Click on the "Import from 9GAG" button

## How do I find the 9GAG URL of an image?

On the web, open the picture you want to select and copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

## Why don't I see the 9GAG icon?

If you don't see the 9GAG icon, it could be because:

- Your browser does not support importing an image from 9GAG; if this is the case, you should update your browser
- The website has not enabled the 9GAG import feature
