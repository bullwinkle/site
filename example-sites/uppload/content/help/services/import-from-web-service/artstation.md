# Import image from ArtStation

## How do I upload an image using ArtStation?

You can import an image using its ArtStation URL and then perform manipulations (like cropping or filters). ArtStation URLs start with "artstation.com".

1. Find the ArtStation URL of your photo and copy it
2. Click on the "ArtStation" button in the widget
3. Paste the ArtStation URL in the textbox
4. Click on the "Import from ArtStation" button

## How do I find the ArtStation URL of an image?

On the web, open the picture you want to select and copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

## Why don't I see the ArtStation icon?

If you don't see the ArtStation icon, it could be because:

- Your browser does not support importing an image from ArtStation; if this is the case, you should update your browser
- The website has not enabled the ArtStation import feature
