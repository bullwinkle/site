# Import image from Facebook

## How do I upload an image using Facebook?

You can import an image using its Facebook URL and then perform manipulations (like cropping or filters). Facebook URLs start with "facebook.com", "fb.com", or "fb.me".

1. Find the Facebook URL of your photo and copy it
2. Click on the "Facebook" button in the widget
3. Paste the Facebook URL in the textbox
4. Click on the "Import from Facebook" button

## How do I find the Facebook URL of an image?

On the web, open the picture you want to select and copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

## Why don't I see the Facebook icon?

If you don't see the Facebook icon, it could be because:

- Your browser does not support importing an image from Facebook; if this is the case, you should update your browser
- The website has not enabled the Facebook import feature
