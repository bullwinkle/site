# Import image from Reddit

## How do I upload an image using Reddit?

You can import an image using its Reddit URL and then perform manipulations (like cropping or filters). Reddit URLs start with "reddit.com".

1. Find the Reddit URL of your photo and copy it
2. Click on the "Reddit" button in the widget
3. Paste the Reddit URL in the textbox
4. Click on the "Import from Reddit" button

## How do I find the Reddit URL of an image?

On the web, open the picture you want to select and copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

## Why don't I see the Reddit icon?

If you don't see the Reddit icon, it could be because:

- Your browser does not support importing an image from Reddit; if this is the case, you should update your browser
- The website has not enabled the Reddit import feature
