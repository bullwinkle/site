# Import image from Flickr

## How do I upload an image using Flickr?

You can import an image using its Flickr URL and then perform manipulations (like cropping or filters). Flickr URLs start with "flickr.com" or "flic.kr".

1. Find the Flickr URL of your photo and copy it
2. Click on the "Flickr" button in the widget
3. Paste the Flickr URL in the textbox
4. Click on the "Import from Flickr" button

## How do I find the Flickr URL of an image?

On the web, open the picture you want to select and copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

## Why don't I see the Flickr icon?

If you don't see the Flickr icon, it could be because:

- Your browser does not support importing an image from Flickr; if this is the case, you should update your browser
- The website has not enabled the Flickr import feature
