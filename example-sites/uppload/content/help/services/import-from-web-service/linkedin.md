# Import image from LinkedIn

## How do I upload an image using LinkedIn?

You can import an image using its LinkedIn URL and then perform manipulations (like cropping or filters). LinkedIn URLs start with "linkedin.com".

1. Find the LinkedIn URL of your photo and copy it
2. Click on the "LinkedIn" button in the widget
3. Paste the LinkedIn URL in the textbox
4. Click on the "Import from LinkedIn" button

## How do I find the LinkedIn URL of an image?

On the web, open the picture you want to select and copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

## Why don't I see the LinkedIn icon?

If you don't see the LinkedIn icon, it could be because:

- Your browser does not support importing an image from LinkedIn; if this is the case, you should update your browser
- The website has not enabled the LinkedIn import feature
