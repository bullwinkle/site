# Import image from Fotki

## How do I upload an image using Fotki?

You can import an image using its Fotki URL and then perform manipulations (like cropping or filters). Fotki URLs start with "fotki.com".

1. Find the Fotki URL of your photo and copy it
2. Click on the "Fotki" button in the widget
3. Paste the Fotki URL in the textbox
4. Click on the "Import from Fotki" button

## How do I find the Fotki URL of an image?

On the web, open the picture you want to select and copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

## Why don't I see the Fotki icon?

If you don't see the Fotki icon, it could be because:

- Your browser does not support importing an image from Fotki; if this is the case, you should update your browser
- The website has not enabled the Fotki import feature
