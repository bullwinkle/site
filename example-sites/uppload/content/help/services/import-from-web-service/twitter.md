# Import image from Twitter

## How do I upload an image using Twitter?

You can import an image using its Twitter URL and then perform manipulations (like cropping or filters). Twitter URLs start with "twitter.com" or "t.co".

1. Find the Twitter URL of your photo and copy it
2. Click on the "Twitter" button in the widget
3. Paste the Twitter URL in the textbox
4. Click on the "Import from Twitter" button

## How do I find the Twitter URL of an image?

On the web, open the picture you want to select and copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

## Why don't I see the Twitter icon?

If you don't see the Twitter icon, it could be because:

- Your browser does not support importing an image from Twitter; if this is the case, you should update your browser
- The website has not enabled the Twitter import feature
