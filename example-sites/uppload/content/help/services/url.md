1. Find the URL of your photo and copy it
2. Click on the "Direct URL" button in the widget
3. Paste the URL in the textbox
4. Click on the "Import from URL" button

## How do I find the URL of an image?

### Web

On the web, open the picture you want to select and copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

## Why don't I see the Direct URL icon?

If you don't see the Direct URL icon, it could be because:

- Your browser does not support importing an image from URL; if this is the case, you should update your browser
- The website has not enabled the Direct URL import feature
