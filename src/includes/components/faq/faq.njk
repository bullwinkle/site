    <details>
      <summary>What are Secrets?</summary>
      Secrets are a form of encrypted text storage that allow you to store
      sensitive information. For example, you can use Secrets to store your
      username and password to use Puppet when logging in to web services.
      Secrets are encrypted with AES-256 using a unique key specific to you.

      <summary>How unlimited is unlimited, really?</summary>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Unlimited fair usage: As long as you don't crash our servers, you can
          use as many jobs as you like. We have a rate limit of 100 requests per
          minute. We'll let you know if we're not comfortable with your usage,
          but this has never happened before.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Puppet Master plan, we don't cap the job duration, but any
          running jobs will stop if we're running maintenance or updating our
          APIs. You should be fine as long as you don't run a job longer than
          tens of hours. This has also never happened before.
