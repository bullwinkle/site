# Getting started

Oswald Labs (formerly Oswald Foundation) is an India and Netherlands-based accessibility technology company that builds products for individuals with disabilities. It specializes in enterprise web accessibility, offers smartphone apps, and also runs a startup accelerator. It was established in 2016 by Anand Chowdhary, Nishant Gadihoke and Mahendra Raghuwanshi after their product, Oswald Extension, won an event at the AngelHack hackathon in New Delhi.

In an interview with The Huffington Post, Chowdhary said that he believes "Oswald \[Labs] can enable a Web 4.0, a web centered around accessibility and equality". Oswald Labs is named in honor of Oswald Berkhan, the German physician who first identified dyslexia in 1881.
